            <br /><P align=center>Choosing&nbsp;A Career</P><P>When students graduate from college,many of them do not know how they want to spend their working lives and they sometimes move from job to job, until they find something that suits them and of equally importance to which they are suited. Others never find a job in which they are really happy. They remain all their lives square pegs in round holes. When we choose our careers we need to ask ourselves two questions. First, what do we think we would like to be? Second, what kind of people are we? The idea, for example of being a painter or a musician may seem very attractive, but unless we have great talent, and are willing to work very hard. We are certain to fail in these occupations and failure will lead to unhappiness in life. So it is important to assess our suitability for a certain career in job search.</P><br />
